WWW::HtmlUnit::Spidey

Spidey is a Perl wrapper of HtmlUnit for web scraping.

It sits on top of the CPAN module WWW::HtmlUnit but departs from any
Mechanize-ish syntax.

It is for all those that need enough JavaScript support but don't like Java
and want to develop scalable web crawlers in Perl, working at a very abstract
level just like when using a browser manually!

Infact Spidey is much faster and robust than driving a real browser as with
WWW::Mechanize::Firefox.
